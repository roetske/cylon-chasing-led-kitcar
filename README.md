# cylon-chasing-led-kitcar
scripts for running cylon effect with ledstrips
sk6812 was a nightmare to get settings right grbw was the setting jeezes
Had this strip laying around and did test, problem is spacing between the leds for my strip 25mm too big.
Fatled did not get working for sk6812.
Adafruit neopixel worked ;). Worked also with buffer for com levelshifter 3.3v to 5v.
